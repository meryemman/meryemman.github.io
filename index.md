# About Me 💡

I am a second year Ph.D. candidate at [Mohammed 5 University](http://www.um5.ac.ma/um5/) (`UM5`) [Mohammadia school of engineer](https://www.emi.ac.ma/) (`EMI`), Rabat - Morocco, under the supervision of [Prof. Ghassane ANIBA](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rQiL-HEAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I obtained my Master degree from [`FSDM` - `USMBA`](http://www.fsdmfes.ac.ma/). My major research interest lies in the intersection of *Data Sciences* and *Computer Vision* and *NLP*, as well as the *Automatic Speech Recognition*. See my [Google scholar]() for more details.

I will enter the job market soon. If you are interested in my background, please contact me: [meryem DOT manessouri AT gmail DOT com](mailto:meryem.manessouri@gmail.com) or [meryemmanessouri AT research DOT emi DOT ac DOT ma](mailto:meryemmanessouri@research.emi.ac.ma).

## Academic Project 📝

* Automatic Micro-Expression Recognition (AMER) [🔗]() (01/2020–02/2020)
  > This project was about providing an Android application that can help people take charge of their own emotional health by capturing their micro expressions such as happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise, fear, and neutral. This application consumes a web service which contains our finally Model. This Model predictor is created after testing different approaches for the facial expression recognition. the elaborated approaches are based on different algorithm for features extraction and different machine learning classifiers. The proposed automatic micro expression recognition (AMER) uses: OpenCV, Python and machine learning Algorithms.

## Hobbies 😍

* Traveling 🧳.
* Sports 🚴‍♂️: Hiking 🚶‍♀️ in Fes, running 🏃 on the beach in Asilah, practicing Fitness/Crossfit. I used to play volleyball. I also used to (and still do sometimes) practice Taekwondo.
* Reading/Learning 💻: I spend most of my free time trying to learn stuffs. I try to do 1 online course per month, although I don't always manage to do so.

🎯 That's all the fork 🙏
